## Kargaroth History
### The Campaign Thus Far
This section will be divided up into the major arcs, each will have a section for general information anyone in the outside world could know about the party and their accomplishments and a section of meta-game material that goes in more detail about the things they have and haven’t completed. If a particular arc interests you, and that’s the arc you want to tie your character into the party with feel free to give it a read. If you’re just the type of person who wants to get a better sense of what’s going on and how everything has been working out so far, that’s also fine, but the meta material is optional.

#### The Spider Den Arc

This is the arc the party formed, everyone for whatever reason found themselves in Silathgroth there a scouting operation was being conducted, but the elven army hadn’t officially moved in yet so they recruited adventures and mercenaries. Every team heads out with an army official. The party goes out with their Blood Guard (the rank below the lowest officer) Raelrinn. Of course it turned out Raelrinn had been murder and in his place a drow operative was stand in. The first arc was mostly a dungeon crawl, they fought an arachnomaner who is basically an officer of the Zicarae forces.

Raelrinn has been reincarnated twice now, and it seems he’s been promoted, but he’s definitely after the party. It’s more than just revenge though, he’s after something the party has. 

Possible Plot Hook:
- You used to work under Hadulus
- You used to be one of Hadulus’ experiments
- You used to be one of Zicarae’s soldiers
- You’re a historian of sorts, and after investigating the cave after the party cleared it out you uncovered something
```
#### The Dalamar Arc
This arc was primary a mystery which lead into a puzzle dungeon. Young elven women have been going missing around the town. These women just disappeared, alone or in the company of others. One moment they’re there the next they’re gone. All the elven women are between the ages of 150 to 320 years old. The entire town is scared and on edge as the adventurers return from their extended mission. At first only a few women went missing but over time more and more women go missing each day. The party discover that at each abduction site there is a temporary cold spot. They concluded that the women are being teleported away, but that the space she went to was being swapped. The party talks to Elwin who warms them not to go and save the women, that there is no hope, they are already lost. Dalamar was kidnapping the women. Dalamar is an exceptionally powerful wizard, the strongest mortal of this age that the council is aware of. Cecilia the current High Sorceress of the city explained that Dalamar would be away from his tower during the grand magic conference. The grand magic conference is a neutral zone, Good, Neutral, and Evil casters alike join together to celebrate, learn and trade magics. Many casters particularly the arcane value magic above all else and the pursuit of magic goes above moral divides. It isn’t impossible for an evil master to teach a good student or vice versa. So despite Dalamar being exceptionally evil his contribution to magic is highly valued at these events. Cecilia helps the party reach his tower before he gets back in an effort to try and free the women held. Meanwhile Cecilia, Cinder, and Lava prepare the village for defense knowing that surely Dalamar will discover what happened and come after them. Dalamar did find out about the party and they’re plan and came to attack Silathgroth. The city somewhat prepared raised a shield with arch wizard Draharak’s help. The shield fell however, which would have killed everyone had lava not had a contingency spell to teleport the cities people away. Unfortunately, Dalamar watched as the city fell, so the spell had to be activated as the city was being destroy or Dalamar would know and hunt the survivors down. 
```ad-note

The more arcane inclined could have realized someone or something sabotaged the shield, that’s why it fell under the weight of the Meteor Swarm. Additionally, the locations of the abducted women created the outline of a large necromantic spell. Essentially Dalamar was strategically abducting women is locations to draw a spell circle to sacrifice the entire village in order to create a phylactery. Additionally, as this is pretty gruesome so you may want to stop reading this part, he was abducting young women to impregnate and then sacrifice both mother and fetus in order to collect 2 souls instead of just one. 

Possible Plot Hook:
- Who know who sabotaged the shield
- You used to work for Dalamar
- You are related to his current assistant
- You were one of the women capture
```
#### The Ruined War Arc
After Dalamar dropped the Meteor Swarm on the city of Silathgroth, 60% of the inhabitants were safely teleported to Y’llthyr the other 40% died. Silathgroth was left a ruined crater. Currently Legionnaire Cinder is leading an army to reclaim Silathgroth, with acting knowledge that Zicarea’s forces also have their eye on Silathgroth. Silathgroth was the last bastion that stood against the Drider forces, with it fallen the Elves stand in an extremely vulnerable place. Reclaiming the city is of the utmost importance. Not only that but the late Magic Dealer Lava and her emporium was one of the greatest collections of magic items, losing that could spell the end for all of Kargaroth. 
```ad-note

Clay forged a deal with Cinder to first march her army into the lost city of Ishmanore, using it as a safe resting point for her army, knowing that the drow forces were likely only to engage at night this gave the elves the additional time to rest and prepare before they reach Silathgroth. The lost city of Ishmanore was a beacon of healing before the cataclysm. The city fell as Ochena was retracted from the world behind the great divide. Swiftly after demons swooped in a perverted the city, and without the divine protection from the High Cleric and without the divine intervention from Ochena. Other major cities fell around the world as well, but few stood as high as Ishmanore. Reclaiming Ishmanore Clay inherited it as the leader of the village, legally the Emerald Dragon Lissandra communed with the Elven Noble to allow ownership of the city to Pyre. Though Pyre fell with Silathgroth, Lissandra managed to shift ownership to clay so long as the drow may live, with the condition the city would return to elven leadership once Clay passed. 

Possible Plot Hook:

-   You work for Lissandra the Emerald Dragon and she sent you to help
    
-   You’re a survivor from the fall of Silathgroth and its time to reclaim your home and more
    
-   You’re an Arcanist working in Cinder’s army, but you know what the unusual rock the party is holding is really for.
    
-   The Aracnomancer captured someone you care about; this war is the first time you’ve been able to get close to him you won’t let this opportunity go missed.

# Gilford's Dreamscape
Gilford tells us the following:
- Person we should most worry about is [[Characters/NPCs/Kuriboh]]
* Person who is beneficial for us to know is [[Characters/NPCs/Kyrara]]
* A person to be aware of is [[Characters/NPCs/Pierre]]
* He is intimate with all the gods
* We obviously didn't ask for your help beforehand, but is there anything Gilford learned during this battle? Notes can be found [[Characters/NPCs/Hadulus|here]]
* Are there any thoughts / concerns on how we as a team can do better? Our greatest weakness & strength is our individuality
* Why did Hadulus want to talk instead of fight? Can we exploit his desire to converse? Answer can be found [[Characters/NPCs/Hadulus|here]]
* The last Gilford heard, the rest of Ulneth's Hammer was with the dwarves as an heirloom of the king
* Gilford offers [[Characters/Gods/Seraphina, the Balanced#Artifact|Ataraxia, the Dragonlance]] to the party and Solumn accepts it

# Waking up
We wake up from Gilford's Dreamscape to the sound of 2 men laughing.

Clay & I lead the party towards the 2 Elves (Uriel & Mariah) who stand to attention at the sight of us. They were sent here in shifts. They tell us that a lot has happened:
- Its been 6 months since we entered Gilford's Dreamscape
- Cinder has continued east to the Dryder island
- All elven area has been reclaimed
- Lava and Draharek are reinforcing cities
- Zicara may be defeated by next year
Their commanding officer is Illyrden
- Illyrden knows [[Characters/Player Characters/Lykin]] from Lykin's military days. 

As we leave the cave, we see the 5 man band (Ylorb + Crew) fighting the elves that are stationed here.

# Meeting [[Characters/Player Characters/Niko]]
As combat is wrapping up, a giant firey bird comes flying towards us. (Wynfrid sees evocation magic surrounding it). As it crashes into our area, [[Characters/Player Characters/Niko]] appears in the aftermath of the crash. She says she was sent by [[Characters/NPCs/Cinder]] (her friend). 

She mentions going to see Cinder. To help transport the prisoners from [[_The Story#Fight with Ylorb|the previous fight]], Niko mentions storing them in her basement. 

While introducing ourselves, she summons a giant bull, Derek. 
![[Characters/Player Characters/Derek, Niko's Bull.png]]

We elect to scrap our plans of grabbing more artifacts for now, and go see Cinder. 

Illyrden tells Lykin that the information Lykin gave Cinder has heavily shifted the tides of war. 
- Dalamar has retreated

(We then help clean up after the battle and take care of cremations.) 

Niko pulls out a key, touches it to a key, and creates a portal to her house (in hell). 

While at Niko's house, we get food. After some time, one of the prisoners (the bandaged man) begins to awaken. 

![[Characters/Player Characters/Clay#Description and Origin#Conversations in Niko's Hut]]

Valdorn mentions that [[Characters/NPCs/Ylorb]] is [[Characters/Gods/Cijun, the Defiler|Cijun]]'s failed vessal. He mentions that most (if not all) of the gods are trying to break through the veil. 

Valdorn says that Ylorb was not attempted to be made into a [[Other Notes/Gods' Vessels|vessel]] in the same way that Zicara is trying to make her vessal. 

Valdorn says that Ylorb is looking for [[Characters/Gods/Cijun, the Defiler#Artifact - Atherius|Atherius]] so that he can have more room for the divinity. Holding [[Characters/Gods/Cijun, the Defiler#Artifact - Atherius|Atherius]] may have helped him hold [[Cijun, the Defiler|Cijun]]'s power and power up [[Characters/Gods/Cijun, the Defiler#Artifact - Atherius|Atherius]]. 

A god with their armament may be unstoppable. Valdorn says a mage of some sort told him this, but he says he doesn't recognize the name [[Characters/NPCs/Dalamar]].  The mage spoke with an ancient human accent that he didn't recognize. Lykin mentions that this could've been someone from before the [[Important Events/Great God War]]. 

Clay tells Valdorn that we will keep him in Niko's House for a bit longer, but Valdorn states that he is bound to (since he's a revenant) try to leave and take [[Characters/Gods/Cijun, the Defiler#Artifact - Atherius|Atherius]]. 

# Deals, Info and Beginnings
The mage ([[Characters/NPCs/Aurora]]) of the opposing party starts to stir awake, and asks, "Where are we?" and [[Characters/Player Characters/Azrael]] welcomes her to Hell. 

Of all of the members of the opposing party, the only one that is threatening to us is [[Characters/NPCs/Ylorb]]. I place my Dimensional Shackles on him. 

We decide to store the prisoners in [[Characters/Player Characters/Niko]]'s basement. 

We decide to leave Niko's house and return to the spider dungeon near the elves that fought with Ylorb's gang and where we entered Niko's house. 

[[Characters/Player Characters/Lykin]] teleports us to [[Characters/NPCs/Lava]]'s shop, _Lava's Magical Emporium_. We enter the shop after [[Characters/Player Characters/Clay]] and [[Characters/NPCs/Sarada]] exchange greetings. Sarada glances at [[Characters/Player Characters/Niko]] and says, "That's a lot of magic". 

Lava comes from the back and greets us. We talk with her and she mentions our increase in power.  Lykin recounts our adventure's in [[_The Story#Gilford's Dreamscape|Gilford's Dreamscape]] at a high level. 

Clay signs us up to kill [[Characters/Gods/Cijun, the Defiler|Cijun]]. Lava tells us that in order to kill a god, we must replace them, but she doesn't know what would happen if we elected to not replace the god. (Wynfrid is interested in this prospect). Wynfrid brings up replacing the gods with the party. 

Lava mentions that many gods seem to be emboldened by the creation of failed vessels to create their own vessels. 

Wynfrid mentions killing the gods, and Niko agrees with the death of [[Characters/Gods/Chaos, the Infinity|Chaos]], but not replacing the others with mortals.

```

Wynfrid tells Niko that the Blue Crusade kidnapped her father to create Zicarae's vessel and her families vault is under the _supervision_ of a man named [[Characters/NPCs/Drar]]. Niko mentions that she knows Drar (calls him "very handsome"). 

Niko offers a favor in exchange for a question to [[Characters/NPCs/Sarada]]. The question is, "Do you know where [[Characters/Gods/Kyrena, the Naturalist|Kyrena]]'s Champion is located". Sarada responds that [[Characters/NPCs/Uriphina]] can be found at the gateway between the feywild and the material plane (top left of the elven territory). 

Lava tells Lykin that last she heard, the _Tome of Lies_ resides in the Shadowfell. The Vampire King ([[Characters/NPCs/Strahd von Zarovich]]) was the last known person to own it. If we choose to go after this item, bring lots of sunlight. 

Lava knows the following about Beginning:
- No one wields it as far as she knows
- [[Aterna, the Wonderstruck|Aterna]] has been quiet (potentially no Champion or Voice)
- Do not forget about "our End" (potential Butt joke). 

```ad-note

## The Temple of [[Aterna, the Wonderstruck|Aterna]]
We teleport to the mouth of the cave that I got End in. As we traverse the cave, we see large crystals (potentially worth a bit). The cave operates & functions as a temple to [[Characters/Gods/Aterna, the Wonderstruck|Aterna]]. We traverse through the cave and come across the alter with _Beginning_ on it. I put my hand on the sword, asking [[Aterna, the Wonderstruck|Aterna]] for wisdom and strength. I feel tingling come from the sword. As I tug on it, the sword is heavy and does not budge. 

"[[Aterna, the Wonderstruck|Aterna]], What do I need to do to gain your favor and wield such a mighty weapon?" A bug climbs on me and I swat it away, tracking it with my eyes. I see small writing and kneel down to try to read it, but can't. Lykin casts _Comprehend Language_ and reads it aloud. 

"To pick up your end, you must start your beginning and to pick up your beginning you must complete your end."

I renounce my oath of personal revenge and take up a new oath of righteous vengeance. 

We teleport back to Silathgroth with no problems.
