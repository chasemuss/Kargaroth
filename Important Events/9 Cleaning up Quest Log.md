>"SOS: Emergency. Please meet us at Lava's Shop ASAP. There will be a war in Ishmanor not long from now. Bring Powerful Friends." He just sent it in the envelope chat instead of directly" - Lykin

We get the above message from Lykin and come up with the following plan:
- Go to Drar
- Get Byvitar's Weapon from Vera
- Elemental Plane of Air (if able)
- Go help the other team

We teleport to hell and go to [[Drar]]'s palace. Drar does not believe us when we tell him that we saw [[Xinzounux]]. We challenge him on his doubts and he refuses to budge. 

Proof of Xin's existance
- His Phylactery
- His Body Parts (or body)
- Dalamar (as prisoner)
- Tome of Visions (see [[The Atlas of Creation]])
- His Demiplane

After the frustration that is negotiating with Drar, we decide to teleport out and achieve a different goal.
