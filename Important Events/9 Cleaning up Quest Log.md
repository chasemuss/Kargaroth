>"SOS: Emergency. Please meet us at Lava's Shop ASAP. There will be a war in Ishmanor not long from now. Bring Powerful Friends." He just sent it in the envelope chat instead of directly" - Lykin

We get the above message from Lykin and come up with the following plan:
- Go to Drar
- Get Byvitar's Weapon from Vera
- Elemental Plane of Air (if able)
- Go help the other team

We teleport to hell and go to [[Drar]]'s palace. Drar does not believe us when we tell him that we saw [[Xinzounux]]. We challenge him on his doubts and he refuses to budge. 

Proof of Xin's existance
- His Phylactery
- His Body Parts (or body)
- Dalamar (as prisoner)
- Tome of Visions (see [[The Atlas of Creation]])
- His Demiplane

After the frustration that is negotiating with Drar, we decide to teleport out and achieve a different goal and teleport to the [[Malachite League]]

While there, we meet Cecelia, a master Diviner. I touch the Master Scrying Crystal Ball and see a large variety of Aterna centered foci. 

We get to her office and tell her about [[Solumn]]'s relationship with [[Byvitar, the Trickster]]. After that explanation, she starts scrying [[Vera]] and tells us that she is in a caravan with a [[Blue Crusade]] emblem. Cecelia then gives [[Meridian]] the knowledge of Vera's location. 

With that, Meridian tries to teleport us to Vera but throws us off course and we land in the ocean, with [[Azrael]] sinking us because he has the bronze armor. While sinking, Meridian cast teleport again and got us on target to Vera. We find her and Solumn talks with her in regards to her weapon. 

She wants the following trade:
|     **She Gets**      |         **We Get**          |
|:---------------------:|:---------------------------:|
|       Ataraxia        | Twilight for the coming war | 
| Twilight after Battle |                             |

Solumn agrees to the trade.
