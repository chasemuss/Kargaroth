# Gilford's Dreamscape
Gilford tells us the following:
- Person we should most worry about is [[Characters/NPCs/Kuriboh]]
* Person who is beneficial for us to know is [[Characters/NPCs/Kyrara]]
* A person to be aware of is [[Characters/NPCs/Pierre]]
* He is intimate with all the gods
* We obviously didn't ask for your help beforehand, but is there anything Gilford learned during this battle? Notes can be found [[Characters/NPCs/Hadulus|here]]
* Are there any thoughts / concerns on how we as a team can do better? Our greatest weakness & strength is our individuality
* Why did Hadulus want to talk instead of fight? Can we exploit his desire to converse? Answer can be found [[Characters/NPCs/Hadulus|here]]
* The last Gilford heard, the rest of Ulneth's Hammer was with the dwarves as an heirloom of the king
* Gilford offers [[Characters/Gods/Seraphina, the Balanced#Artifact|Ataraxia, the Dragonlance]] to the party and Solumn accepts it

# Waking up
We wake up from Gilford's Dreamscape to the sound of 2 men laughing.

Clay & I lead the party towards the 2 Elves (Uriel & Mariah) who stand to attention at the sight of us. They were sent here in shifts. They tell us that a lot has happened:
- Its been 6 months since we entered Gilford's Dreamscape
- Cinder has continued east to the Dryder island
- All elven area has been reclaimed
- Lava and Draharek are reinforcing cities
- Zicara may be defeated by next year
Their commanding officer is Illyrden
- Illyrden knows [[Characters/Player Characters/Lykin]] from Lykin's military days. 

# Waking Up
As we leave the cave, we see the 5 man band (Ylorb + Crew) fighting the elves that are stationed here.
