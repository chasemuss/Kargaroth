[[Solumn]] gets info from [[Yondu]] and [[Niko]] gets info as a blacksmith. 

_Solumn's Info_:
- Yondu gets us to a contact that takes us to Hell
- There's a door behind a waterfall to a secret meeting spot and that people will be waiting for Solumn there
_Niko's Info_:
- The entrance to the underground cave is behind a waterfall but is only visible by the light of the full moon. 
As Solumn tries to get away from _SOMEONE_, a man with glowing blue eyes follows him. 

Wynfrid comes back to camp and requests help. So [[Set]] and [[Azrael]] tag along to help be "intimidating" in her meeting with [[Yondu]]. 

We reach Yondu shop. As we enter, he appears to be talking into a sending stone, but abruptly stops when we enter. He recognizes [[Wynfrid]] and asks about her family. 

Yondu mentions that he has been working with Drar consistently. Wynfrid announces that the _Wolke Empire_ is rising again. 

Wynfrid commands Yondu to set up a meeting with [[Drar'Gith]] and he refuses. She calls on his history with her family and he finally relents. He mentions [[Teralis]] as the way to get us into and out of hell. Yondu mentions that Teralis will be here tonight. Yondu says that he'll give us a letter of introduction for [[Drar'Gith]].

Solumn (while poisoned / drunk) bumps into us and throws up on me. He drops a rock near me. I cure him of his drunkenness and he says that he is being followed by someone with magic. 

Wynfrid has me hold him while she punches him. I toss Solumn into the river below and intimidate the Solumn's tail. 

We regroup at camp. Clay & I spar while Niko and Wynfrid talk. 

![[Hell]]

**Party Split**
After a bit longer, the remainder of us make our way to the Black Market. 
- [x] Wynfrid need fire protection
	- [x] Buy Potions of Fire Resistance (1000 GP for a day's worth of potions)

**I help a guard git gud by teaching him about armor and weapons.

We find Yondu and he guides us to [[Teralis]]. He asks where we are trying to go, and Wynfrid says "Hell to see [[Drar'Gith]]"
- We know where he is in hell and Teralis can take us as close as a mile to his lands. 
Wynfrid & Teralis make an agreement that Teralis will take us to hell in 10 hours for 12 hours if able. 

Wynfrid changes out the lenses in her Artifact to be mundane and put the other ones in a case and gives it to me(?). 

We meet up with Teralis and he summons a small person ([[Meridian]]). 

Meridian and Teralis take us to Hell and we make our way to Drar's fortress. 

While at the fortress, we begin negotiations with Drar.
