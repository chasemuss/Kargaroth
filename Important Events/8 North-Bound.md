We travel to the Elven Capital and collect a map, trying to figure out where to go. [[Solumn]] uses his artifact and it directs him to [[Rhys]]'s hometown, Lyseer. 

We hit up a magic shop in the Elven Capital before heading out to Lyseer and [[Wynfrid]] has some transaction with the shopkeep. 

[[Meridian]] teleports us to the crater where Lyseer used to reside. We see nothing but desolation and a mass graveyard (magically dug within the past few weeks). This is reminescent of Silothgroth from the prior timeline. As we look around, the air gets colder. 

[[Wynfrid]] detects that the meteor swarm that hit the city was cast at a level greater than 9th. 

Looking amongst the graves, the only one that is disturbed is [[Rhys]]'s, which has his body, but no head. [[Wynfrid]] goes to search his body and finds nothing. 

I pull out my blades and they hum while around the graves. While I do this, [[Wynfrid]] prays to [[Boaos, the Unknown Reaper|Boaos]]. After praying, she sees him perched on a tombstone with a scythe. She asks for guidance from him and he tells her that the souls here did not return to "the wheel" (reincarnation wheel). They were consumed before they could leave by [[Dalamar]]. He was here with [[Xinzounux]]. They came here because [[Rhys]] was here with him Tome of Undeath. When combined with [[Dalamar]]'s Tome of Death, Damalar now has the Necronomicon. She asks him about the well of magic, and he responds that there are several of them, but the last pure source is him.

When asking for further guidance, he tells her that if she feels she is walking in circles, then she probably already knows where to go. If she feels unprepared, then what does it take to be prepared? She says, more power would help her feel more prepared, and he tells her to take it from those who have it. He tells her that her family's network of magic item sellers is power. She says that she doesn't have power but he repeats what he said earlier. She says that [[Dalamar]] has the power she wants, and he tells her to kill him. She inquires about her father, and is told that he is still alive. 

[[Boaos, the Unknown Reaper|Boaos]] says that he has seen everyone die, including [[Chaos, the Infinity|Chaos]], who was consumed by [[Byvitar, the Trickster]], assuming his position. 

She wants the following:
- How do we kill [[Dalamar]]?
- How do we get his phylactery?
- How to kill [[Drar]]?
- How to kill everyone who has spat at the Wolke Name?

He mentions that she wants the power of death, and offers it to her, but it comes at a cost and can't be revoked. She agrees to it take the power of death. He holds out his scythe and she..._hesitates_. She asks what the catch is before accepting it, and he claims to not have an angle. He wants her to complete the goals set forth before by her, but by accepting the scythe, she will see everyone die again and again. After hearing the boons that come with the scythe, she **takes it**. Her skin becomes transluscent, and her bones become pale-green. She looks ghostly. A murder of crows flock to her. She gains a new vision, "Winds of Death". Her normal vision turns to the Curse of the Megir (Same as [[Clay]]). 

She activates the Winds of Death, and sees a purple high elf with two books. The elf merges the two books and calls down the spheres that ravage the town. The spheres are made of bones and corpses of various monsters, beasts, and humanoids. All of the souls from the town were put into a phylactery (probably [[Xinzounux]])
