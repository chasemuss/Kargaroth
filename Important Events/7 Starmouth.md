We relax after our descent into hell by going to a pub (_The Amber Fox_) in [[Starmouth]]. [[Meridian]] contacts [[Teralis]] and Teralis teleports to us after we've had a bit much to drink. 

While waiting for Teralis, [[Solumn]] flips his coin and activates a "Zone of Games". He decides we will play "Liar Liar" (Tell 2 truths, but can be _technically_ true while not exactly what the questioner wanted).  Throughout the duration of the game, Solumn tells a lie and becomes cursed with lips made of fish. 

We make our way to the temple district of Starmouth, and a lady approaches Solumn, asking if he wants to play the games at [[Byvitar, the Trickster|Byvitar's]] temple.
