We relax after our descent into hell by going to a pub (_The Amber Fox_) in [[Starmouth]]. [[Meridian]] contacts [[Teralis]] and Teralis teleports to us after we've had a bit much to drink. 

While waiting for Teralis, [[Solumn]] flips his coin and activates a "Zone of Games". He decides we will play "Liar Liar" (Tell 2 truths, but can be _technically_ true while not exactly what the questioner wanted).  Throughout the duration of the game, Solumn tells a lie and becomes cursed with lips made of fish. 

We make our way to the temple district of Starmouth, and a lady approaches Solumn, asking if he wants to play the games at [[Byvitar, the Trickster|Byvitar's]] temple. 

Once we reach the temple square, I head off to [[Aterna, the Wonderstruck|Aterna]]'s temple and [[Wynfrid]] goes to [[Boaos, the Unknown Reaper|Boaos]]'s temple while [[Meridian]] and [[Solumn]] play games at [[Byvitar, the Trickster|Byvitar]]'s temple. 

I have the following conversation with the High Priestess

Azrael:
>I'll say, "I have some questions about some weapons I came across. Please stand back while I summon them" and once she's clear, I'll summon End and Beginning. "Do you know anything about these? I acquired them from a shrine to Aterna" I place them on the table and stand back. 

Priestess:
>Her eyes widen with wonder. Hundreds of questions come flying forth. "A shrine, where. When did you get these? How can you be sure of it's authenticity? They are well crafted aren't they, could they really be Onryx'? " She oicks them up in turn admiring them in the sunlight. After a bit she says "These are real, that's for certain at least. Why have you brought them here?"

Azrael:
>I was wondering what information you had on them and how I can grow their power. I also want to know more about what it means to follow Aterna. I don't want to be irreverent while wielding her swords.

Priestess:	
>"Then let's begin where all good stories do. With the Beginning. This sword has legends of Life and Creation. Legends of adventure, of triumph, of Valor. Of Heroes overcoming adversity. The sword is said to be found first with a young adventure about to take their first steps towards their destiny. Now end is another story. Legends rumor this one is semi sentient and comforts the hero near the end of their journey. They say her voice speaks to you only in your final hour."

Azrael:
>Well, that's a bit awkward. I acquired End a while before acquiring Beginning. Also, I've heard End's voice before I believe

Priestess:
>"Oh that's very curious indeed. As far as the swotds abilities unfortunately those are wildly embellished from various poets and writers. So I can't say for sure what they're capable of. It's possible their power is only truly revealed with the creativity of the wielder. Beginning is said to have the ability to create things while end has the ability to consume and destroy anything. Another few legends say these swords can be joined together in a union. Though the one weilder of such a union suddenly gained the abilities of an extremely high level mage, without the training and abruptly was consumed by the blade."

Azrael:
>Do you know how they went about joining the swords? I remember riddles that needed to be solved by actions to acquire these 2.

Priestess:
>"Legend has is she combined them in desperation. Facing an insurmountable threat the began a new chapter, her final chapter for her final battle and with its climax overcame her adversary, but with that chapter closed so too did her story. The how is lost, perhaps END revealed the path in that moment."

Azrael:
>Well, I _am_ walking into armageddon, so perhaps that will occur to me as well. Thank you (her rank), this information has been quite beneficial. If you hear or learn of anything else regarding these swords, please write it down so that should I come back here, I can learn it as well. Also, my name is Azrael. (I'll lower the bronze to show my true face). It's been an honor and pleasure speaking to you.

Priestess:
> Oh my! Thats sounds wonderful! An amazing story to be sure. I'd be happy to trade you a story of your journeys for a story of your swords. It was a pleasure speaking with you Azreal."

Azrael:
>And with you. Oh! One last thing, do you know where I can find either the Voice or Champion of Aterna?

Priestess:
>Her muse Aterna hasn't had a champion since the divine divide, but her Voice is in the elemental plane of Air, the queen of the Aarokocra herself.

Azrael:
>Interesting. Good to know. Thank you for this information.

Priestess:
>"Travel well Azreal. I'm sure to hear of you again. Chosen sword bearer. Grand adventurer of this Age. May her muse inspire and her bards record, your victory or tragedy a story yet written.

Azrael:
>I hope the disasters far away do no reach this continent and that peace stays here with you

Priestess:
>You'll find disasters where ever you look, a story of triumph yet unwritten. The wails of loss, a song unsung. The blood of the dying, a painting unbrushed. They are all the beginning and the end. Life is an adventure. Good guys and bad alike are characters in a story. What story will you write, which role will you play? I'm sure regardless of your answer it will be worth the read,listen,or viewing.

Azrael:
>Hopefully one of good triumphing over evil

Priestess:
>Those are my favorite too. Though for good to triumph over evil, there must be good. Will you be good Azreal, and how will you know?

Azrael:
>I will, and I know what is good because I used to only work for evil.

I leave and regroup with the others where we learn that Solumn is both the Voice & Champion of Byvitar, leading him to be the best shot at a vessel so far. To help his odds, we should find Byvitar's artifact, which is currently in [[Vera]]'s possession.
