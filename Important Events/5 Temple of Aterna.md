## The Temple of [[Aterna, the Wonderstruck|Aterna]]
We teleport to the mouth of the cave that I got End in. As we traverse the cave, we see large crystals (potentially worth a bit). The cave operates & functions as a temple to [[Characters/Gods/Aterna, the Wonderstruck|Aterna]]. We traverse through the cave and come across the alter with _Beginning_ on it. I put my hand on the sword, asking [[Aterna, the Wonderstruck|Aterna]] for wisdom and strength. I feel tingling come from the sword. As I tug on it, the sword is heavy and does not budge. 

"[[Aterna, the Wonderstruck|Aterna]], What do I need to do to gain your favor and wield such a mighty weapon?" A bug climbs on me and I swat it away, tracking it with my eyes. I see small writing and kneel down to try to read it, but can't. Lykin casts _Comprehend Language_ and reads it aloud. 

"To pick up your end, you must start your beginning and to pick up your beginning you must complete your end."

I renounce my oath of personal revenge and take up a new oath of righteous vengeance. 

We teleport back to Silathgroth with no problems.
