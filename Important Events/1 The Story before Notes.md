## Kargaroth History
### The Campaign Thus Far
This section will be divided up into the major arcs, each will have a section for general information anyone in the outside world could know about the party and their accomplishments and a section of meta-game material that goes in more detail about the things they have and haven’t completed. If a particular arc interests you, and that’s the arc you want to tie your character into the party with feel free to give it a read. If you’re just the type of person who wants to get a better sense of what’s going on and how everything has been working out so far, that’s also fine, but the meta material is optional.

#### The Spider Den Arc

This is the arc the party formed, everyone for whatever reason found themselves in Silathgroth there a scouting operation was being conducted, but the elven army hadn’t officially moved in yet so they recruited adventures and mercenaries. Every team heads out with an army official. The party goes out with their Blood Guard (the rank below the lowest officer) Raelrinn. Of course it turned out Raelrinn had been murder and in his place a drow operative was stand in. The first arc was mostly a dungeon crawl, they fought an arachnomaner who is basically an officer of the Zicarae forces.

Raelrinn has been reincarnated twice now, and it seems he’s been promoted, but he’s definitely after the party. It’s more than just revenge though, he’s after something the party has. 

Possible Plot Hook:
- You used to work under Hadulus
- You used to be one of Hadulus’ experiments
- You used to be one of Zicarae’s soldiers
- You’re a historian of sorts, and after investigating the cave after the party cleared it out you uncovered something
```
#### The Dalamar Arc
This arc was primary a mystery which lead into a puzzle dungeon. Young elven women have been going missing around the town. These women just disappeared, alone or in the company of others. One moment they’re there the next they’re gone. All the elven women are between the ages of 150 to 320 years old. The entire town is scared and on edge as the adventurers return from their extended mission. At first only a few women went missing but over time more and more women go missing each day. The party discover that at each abduction site there is a temporary cold spot. They concluded that the women are being teleported away, but that the space she went to was being swapped. The party talks to Elwin who warms them not to go and save the women, that there is no hope, they are already lost. Dalamar was kidnapping the women. Dalamar is an exceptionally powerful wizard, the strongest mortal of this age that the council is aware of. Cecilia the current High Sorceress of the city explained that Dalamar would be away from his tower during the grand magic conference. The grand magic conference is a neutral zone, Good, Neutral, and Evil casters alike join together to celebrate, learn and trade magics. Many casters particularly the arcane value magic above all else and the pursuit of magic goes above moral divides. It isn’t impossible for an evil master to teach a good student or vice versa. So despite Dalamar being exceptionally evil his contribution to magic is highly valued at these events. Cecilia helps the party reach his tower before he gets back in an effort to try and free the women held. Meanwhile Cecilia, Cinder, and Lava prepare the village for defense knowing that surely Dalamar will discover what happened and come after them. Dalamar did find out about the party and they’re plan and came to attack Silathgroth. The city somewhat prepared raised a shield with arch wizard Draharak’s help. The shield fell however, which would have killed everyone had lava not had a contingency spell to teleport the cities people away. Unfortunately, Dalamar watched as the city fell, so the spell had to be activated as the city was being destroy or Dalamar would know and hunt the survivors down.

The more arcane inclined could have realized someone or something sabotaged the shield, that’s why it fell under the weight of the Meteor Swarm. Additionally, the locations of the abducted women created the outline of a large necromantic spell. Essentially Dalamar was strategically abducting women is locations to draw a spell circle to sacrifice the entire village in order to create a phylactery. Additionally, as this is pretty gruesome so you may want to stop reading this part, he was abducting young women to impregnate and then sacrifice both mother and fetus in order to collect 2 souls instead of just one. 

Possible Plot Hook:
- Who know who sabotaged the shield
- You used to work for Dalamar
- You are related to his current assistant
- You were one of the women capture
```
#### The Ruined War Arc
After Dalamar dropped the Meteor Swarm on the city of Silathgroth, 60% of the inhabitants were safely teleported to Y’llthyr the other 40% died. Silathgroth was left a ruined crater. Currently Legionnaire Cinder is leading an army to reclaim Silathgroth, with acting knowledge that Zicarea’s forces also have their eye on Silathgroth. Silathgroth was the last bastion that stood against the Drider forces, with it fallen the Elves stand in an extremely vulnerable place. Reclaiming the city is of the utmost importance. Not only that but the late Magic Dealer Lava and her emporium was one of the greatest collections of magic items, losing that could spell the end for all of Kargaroth.

Clay forged a deal with Cinder to first march her army into the lost city of Ishmanore, using it as a safe resting point for her army, knowing that the drow forces were likely only to engage at night this gave the elves the additional time to rest and prepare before they reach Silathgroth. The lost city of Ishmanore was a beacon of healing before the cataclysm. The city fell as Ochena was retracted from the world behind the great divide. Swiftly after demons swooped in a perverted the city, and without the divine protection from the High Cleric and without the divine intervention from Ochena. Other major cities fell around the world as well, but few stood as high as Ishmanore. Reclaiming Ishmanore Clay inherited it as the leader of the village, legally the Emerald Dragon Lissandra communed with the Elven Noble to allow ownership of the city to Pyre. Though Pyre fell with Silathgroth, Lissandra managed to shift ownership to clay so long as the drow may live, with the condition the city would return to elven leadership once Clay passed. 

Possible Plot Hook:

-   You work for Lissandra the Emerald Dragon and she sent you to help
    
-   You’re a survivor from the fall of Silathgroth and its time to reclaim your home and more
    
-   You’re an Arcanist working in Cinder’s army, but you know what the unusual rock the party is holding is really for.
    
-   The Aracnomancer captured someone you care about; this war is the first time you’ve been able to get close to him you won’t let this opportunity go missed.
