The mage ([[Aurora]]) of the opposing party starts to stir awake, and asks, "Where are we?" and [[Azrael]] welcomes her to Hell. 

Of all of the members of the opposing party, the only one that is threatening to us is [[Ylorb]]. I place my Dimensional Shackles on him. 

We decide to store the prisoners in [[Niko]]'s basement. 

We decide to leave Niko's house and return to the spider dungeon near the elves that fought with Ylorb's gang and where we entered Niko's house. 

[[Lykin]] teleports us to [[Lava]]'s shop, _Lava's Magical Emporium_. We enter the shop after [[Clay]] and [[Sarada]] exchange greetings. Sarada glances at [[Niko]] and says, "That's a lot of magic". 

Lava comes from the back and greets us. We talk with her and she mentions our increase in power.  Lykin recounts our adventure's in [[2 Gilford's Dreamscape|Gilford's Dreamscape]] at a high level. 

Clay signs us up to kill [[Characters/Gods/Cijun, the Defiler|Cijun]]. Lava tells us that in order to kill a god, we must replace them, but she doesn't know what would happen if we elected to not replace the god. (Wynfrid is interested in this prospect). Wynfrid brings up replacing the gods with the party. 

Lava mentions that many gods seem to be emboldened by the creation of failed vessels to create their own vessels. 

Wynfrid mentions killing the gods, and Niko agrees with the death of [[Characters/Gods/Chaos, the Infinity|Chaos]], but not replacing the others with mortals.

Wynfrid tells Niko that the Blue Crusade kidnapped her father to create Zicarae's vessel and her families vault is under the _supervision_ of a man named [[Drar'Gith]]. Niko mentions that she knows Drar (calls him "very handsome"). 

Niko offers a favor in exchange for a question to [[Sarada]]. The question is, "Do you know where [[Characters/Gods/Kyrena, the Naturalist|Kyrena]]'s Champion is located". Sarada responds that [[Uriphina]] can be found at the gateway between the feywild and the material plane (top left of the elven territory). 

Lava tells Lykin that last she heard, the _Tome of Lies_ resides in the Shadowfell. The Vampire King ([[Strahd von Zarovich]]) was the last known person to own it. If we choose to go after this item, bring lots of sunlight. 

Lava knows the following about Beginning:
- No one wields it as far as she knows
- [[Aterna, the Wonderstruck|Aterna]] has been quiet (potentially no Champion or Voice)
- Do not forget about "our End" (potential Butt joke).
