# Meeting [[Niko]]
As combat is wrapping up, a giant firey bird comes flying towards us. (Wynfrid sees evocation magic surrounding it). As it crashes into our area, [[Niko]] appears in the aftermath of the crash. She says she was sent by [[Cinder]] (her friend). 

She mentions going to see Cinder. To help transport the prisoners from [[2 Gilford's Dreamscape#Fight with Characters/NPCs/Ylorb|the fight with Ylorb]], Niko mentions storing them in her basement. 

While introducing ourselves, she summons a giant bull, Derek.

We elect to scrap our plans of grabbing more artifacts for now, and go see Cinder. 

Illyrden tells Lykin that the information Lykin gave Cinder has heavily shifted the tides of war. 
- Dalamar has retreated

(We then help clean up after the battle and take care of cremations.) 

Niko pulls out a key, touches it to a key, and creates a portal to her house (in hell). 

While at Niko's house, we get food. After some time, one of the prisoners (the bandaged man) begins to awaken.

Valdorn mentions that [[Ylorb]] is [[Characters/Gods/Cijun, the Defiler|Cijun]]'s failed vessal. He mentions that most (if not all) of the gods are trying to break through the veil. 

Valdorn says that Ylorb was not attempted to be made into a [[Other Notes/Gods' Vessels|vessel]] in the same way that Zicara is trying to make her vessal. 

Valdorn says that Ylorb is looking for [[Characters/Gods/Cijun, the Defiler#Artifact - Atherius|Atherius]] so that he can have more room for the divinity. Holding [[Characters/Gods/Cijun, the Defiler#Artifact - Atherius|Atherius]] may have helped him hold [[Cijun, the Defiler|Cijun]]'s power and power up [[Characters/Gods/Cijun, the Defiler#Artifact - Atherius|Atherius]]. 

A god with their armament may be unstoppable. Valdorn says a mage of some sort told him this, but he says he doesn't recognize the name [[Dalamar]].  The mage spoke with an ancient human accent that he didn't recognize. Lykin mentions that this could've been someone from before the [[Great God War]]. 

Clay tells Valdorn that we will keep him in Niko's House for a bit longer, but Valdorn states that he is bound to (since he's a revenant) try to leave and take [[Characters/Gods/Cijun, the Defiler#Artifact - Atherius|Atherius]].
