Obsidian
This wiki was created with the tool Obsidian . While not necessary, it is very useful in navigation and creation of new notes. To download it directly, click here  and install once download is complete. There are aspects of this wiki that do use Obsidian plugins, but they are not heavily used and are convenient.

Git
This vault is stored in a git repository, so Git  is necessary. To download it directly, click here  and install once the download is complete

Configuration
Navigate to Silicon Bayou Repository and clone the repository
Open Obsidian and Open folder as Vault, navigating to the folder where you placed the repository. You now have access to the base wiki. Further steps add additional functionality with add-ons.
Open Settings (gear in the bottom left)
Select "Core Plugins". Enable the option for "Slash Commands". This allows you to press "\" and start typing commands, increasing efficiency.
Select "Files & Links" and deselect "Wikilinks". This changes the formatting of links from [[Homepage]] to Homepage, thus allowing links to work outside of Obisidian.
Recommended Plugins
It is recommended that you enable plug-ins for your vault so that you get additional functionality. This can be done by clicking the gear in the bottom left of the application. Under "Community Plugins", there is an option called "Restricted Mode". Turn this option off.

To add the recommended plugins, Open Settings (gear in the bottom left), select "Browse" next to "Community Plugins" and install the following plugins. There is a brief description/example of each plugin after the name.

Admonition: Allows for side-notes. Without it, these side-notes will look like code blocks
title: Side-Note
collapse: closed
This is an example of a side-note. By changing the collapse attribute between open and closed, we can display different information. 
Advanced Tables: Assists in making tables, as tables can be time-consuming in Markdown.
Column 1	Column 2
PK 1	Value 1
Tasks: Formats "- [ ]" as a check box for tasks that need to be completed
 This is an example
Templater: Allows for JavaScript in templates to make them more dynamic
Obsidian Git: Use git without leaving Obsidian
Execute Code: This allows code to be executed in Obsidian for examples and quick utility
print('Hello World!')
Note: None of these plugins are necessary, but they are very helpful.
