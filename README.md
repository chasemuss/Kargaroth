# Wiki Setup
## Tools
### Obsidian
This wiki was created with the tool [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). While not necessary, it is very useful in navigation and creation of new notes. To download it directly, [click here](https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-releases/releases/download/v1.0.3/Obsidian.1.0.3.exe) and install once download is complete. There are aspects of this wiki that do use Obsidian plugins, but they are not heavily used and are convenient. 

### Git
This vault is stored in a git repository, so [Git](https://git-scm.com/) is necessary. To download it directly, [click here](https://git-scm.com/download/win) and install once the download is complete

## Configuration
1) Navigate to [Kargaroth](https://github.com/chasemuss/Kargaroth/edit/main/README.md) and clone the repository
2) Open Obsidian and _Open folder as Vault_, navigating to the folder where you placed the repository. You now have access to the base wiki. Further steps add additional functionality with add-ons. 
3) Open Settings (gear in the bottom left)
	1) Select "Core Plugins". Enable the option for "Slash Commands". This allows you to press "\\" and start typing commands, increasing efficiency. 
	2) Select "Files & Links" and deselect "Wikilinks". This changes the formatting of links from [[Homepage]] to [Homepage](Homepage.md), thus allowing links to work outside of Obisidian.
