All want to make peace, but want it in different methods

# Cobalt Cascade
- Kill all who disagree with us to achieve peace
- Azrael was a member of this group
- This is the group that Zicara is tentatively aligned with 

They’re the organization of war and suffering, they are the ones who do dealing with the Zicaraen Drow as well as the ones who claims Silathgroth’s neighboring town. Their mission is to remove all the obstacles in this world to rebuild a paradise on the corpses of the evil.

Leader: [[Characters/NPCs/Rimadalf|Rimadalf]]

# Sapphire Skies
- Only way to make a world of true peace, put everyone into a comatose state since humanoids cannot ever make peace

They’re the organization that kidnapped Pyre, and will on rare occasion work for [[Characters/Gods/Zicarae, the Torturer|Zicarae]] for money, tools, or food. Their mission is to create a new world beyond the influence of the gods and build paradise there.

Leader: [[Characters/NPCs/Pierre|Pierre]]

# Lapis Legion
* Solve disputes diplomatically
- Illuminati style world take over (legislatively)

A much smaller group mostly splintered off from the Cobalt Cascade but still very militant. They primarily occupy an area, keep the officials in place but restructure the government of the town they’ve just claimed in order to “peacefully” create a paradise here alongside the current world.
