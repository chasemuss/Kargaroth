# Description and Origin

Azrael is a 6ft 1in 210 lbs Fallen Aasimar and Lawful Neutral Oathbreaker Paladin. His life can be summarized into two parts: Camael and Azrael.

Camael was a Paladin of Conquest, hellbent on bringing [[Characters/Gods/Zicarae, the Torturer|Zicarae]] back to the Material Plane. He was ordained as a prospective champion for her, and trained for years to accomplish that goal. In his devotion to Zicarae, he rose through the ranks of the [[Factions/Blue Crusade]], then the [[Factions/Blue Crusade#Cobalt Cascade|Cobalt Cascade]], eventually reaching the rank of Knight. Camael was completely devoted to his mission, and would do anything to achieve his goal. One day, the Goddess [[Characters/Gods/Seraphina, the Balanced|Seraphina]] called out to him, telling him that there was a sword hidden away that she could guide him to. This sword would elevate his powers, and place him as the primary choice as Zicarae’s Champion. He, in his blind devotion to wanting to be the Champion, followed her orders. Whether he was enchanted, tricked, or she used honeyed words, he doesn’t remember, but what he does remember is getting to the cave where the swords were encased in stone, and trying to pull out the one labeled “[[Characters/Gods/Aterna, the Wonderstruck#Beginning|Beginning]]”. As soon as he pulled, he felt Zicara’s power drain from him. He had been abandoned. Out of rage, he went to grab the other sword, labeled “[[Characters/Gods/Aterna, the Wonderstruck#End|End]]”, and was able to draw it from its stone sheath. The black blade felt light, yet perfectly balanced. The hilt almost seemed to mold to his hand. He knew, by holding that blade, that Zicarae wouldn’t take him back. He also knew that it was Seraphina that bewitched him into breaking his Oath. He let his hatred of the gods manifest itself as his new source of power, becoming Azrael, the Harbinger of Death to those that follow his godly foes. 

Azrael forsake his post in the Cobalt Cascade, traveling from town to town, fighting off monsters for the local populace for money, and striving to reduce the influence of Zicarae and Seraphina in the Material World. He also fights against the Cobalt Cascade since they still side with Zicarae.
