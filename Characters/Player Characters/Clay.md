# Description and Origin

Drow are a matriarchal society being a male he could never hold any real position of power. He couldn’t even join the official ranks of the military if it weren’t for his Legendary War Hero Grandfather, Valian. In a time before the Cataclysm when Zicarae had absolute control over for drow empires Valian lead a revolt against the status quo. With the help of High and Wood elves they pushed the Zicaraen drow out of the mountains in the elven heart land once and for all. Clay (Andrew, yes it got confusing once Clay the person joined the game haha) was a member of the Liberated Drow Forces, one of the only men in the entire force. His division lead by Amora was doing a “routine” sweep of the caverns in the mountains was ambushed by Arachnor a member of the Blue Crusade at the time. In the skirmish his entire unit was wiped out with only a handful of survivors being captured, among them Amora. Clay was thought dead, but Amora sought to it he survived. No one really know what happened to Clay’s Grandfather Valian, many believed he left the nation realizing he had already gone well beyond the status of a male in their society and went to train in isolation. He was known for his blade, many drow would consider it a relic. Clay saw Valian’s blade in the hands of a random bandit that attacked his division. Clay reclaimed his grandfather’s weapon and vows to return it to Valian, or his grave. Now for a while Clay didn’t know who Arachnor was, or know for sure he had Amora. Now just before the war officially started Clay is informed by a Liberated Drow Scout, that Arachnor had captured and is still holding Amora. Additionally, he learned that Arachnor is now a drow, a general in Zicarae’s army when he was a Human working for blue crusade mere months ago

## Conversations in Niko's Hut
[[Clay]] rushes to his side and asks if he is awake, but gets no response. Clay begins to remove the bandages while the man struggles to stop him. Once the bandages are removed, his face is revealed to be severely burned (like Deadpool). Clay mentions that the man may be his grandfather, Valian. Clay draws Atherius and asks if it is his sword, but the man says it _was_. The man says that he is not Valian when asked. Clay asks who he is and he says his name is Valdorn until his father killed him, establishing the man as Clay's father. Clay proceeds to unwrap more of the bandages, showing off burned, damaged draw skin. Valdorn says he doesn't know who Clay is when asked. Clay proceeds to put Atherius to Valdorn 's neck and asks the sword if he knows who he is and if he still holds his sword. Atherius responds that he does for both. 

Clay then uses Atherius to impart knowledge onto Valdorn . Valdorn calls Clay by an alternative name, Valdamir. Clay asks why Valdorn left him with Valian, and Valdorn says it was because he (Valdorn) wasn't strong enough. Valdorn says that Valian killed him a decade after Valdorn gave Clay to Valian. Clay's mother's status is unknown. Valian was not with the Blue Crusade. 

Clay tells Valdorn that he found Atherius on the body of a mercenary (not a drow). 

Valdorn once weilded Atherius, but Valian reclaimed it from him. 

Valdorn mentions that he is a Revenant.
