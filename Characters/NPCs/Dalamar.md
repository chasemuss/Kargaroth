# Notes
An exceptionally powerful Wizard rivaled only by a handful throughput history, but currently stands decidedly on top. At least of those officially recognized by the Mage’s Society. He has only ever had the one assistant, a half elven female name Viola also extremely accomplished. It is rumored that Dalamar is one of Xinzounux’s subordinates but nothing can be proven. What is proven is that Dalamar is wanted by every government on this side of the world for anything ranging from magical espionage to magical larceny to perverse practicing of forbidden magics. Though government officials would love to get their hands on him his is considered too dangerous to go after, and often is holed up in an impenetrable tower shielded by perverted version of the realm of life and darkness. 

Dalamar works of various experiments and undead conjuration, he is believed to be in possession of the Tome of Undeath half of the Codex Necronomicon. His latest experiment involved strategically stealing women around Silathgroth to create a teleportation sigil for the entire city. Not only was he planning on sacrificing the thousands of souls in the city but each of the women he kidnapped was first impregnated as to claim two souls for the price of one. The logical leap was that all these souls were needed for the creation of a phylactery or perhaps to refill one. For this reason, it is believed he is or was working with Xinzounux. 

Dalamar has had contact and dealings with [[Hadulus]] and Lilith as well as the leader of the [[Blue Crusade#Cobalt Cascade|Cobalt Cascade]].
