# Description and Origin
Seraphina prefers a more personal touch though many do not know it is her they are talking to. She doesn’t speak to prays or callings but shows up to aid them unexpectedly. Generally, she appears as an elderly woman granting advice or direction, though occasionally she appears as a wizard or a dragon to offer more advanced aid. Her help always favors the underdogs always adjusting to equilibrium. 

The third born, sister to Phorsphoran and Vandiand. The embodiment of neutrality. Balance, moderation, abstaining for excess, but striving for excellence. She of the three is the most like her father and yet his only real rival. She stands against [[Chaos, the Infinity|chaos]] and brings balance not order. While her brothers fight amongst themselves, she sides with her weaker brother which ever that may be. While no one but her and [[Chaos, the Infinity|chaos]] know it she is far and away stronger than both her brothers. Ready and able should her brothers ever put aside their differences, she alone would stand to oppose them. The mother of humans she spent time with her creation she forged a deep bond with them, learned from them and grew as a god. Her humanity and compassion separate her from the other gods aside from Ochena her grand-daughter. Seraphina claimed hold of the chromatic dragons. While Dragon’s were created by chaos and show no allegiance to anyone of anything but themselves, and the Omni-god chaos. While her brothers account this accomplishment to father’s power of chaos figuring there would be some defected for good or they would have been order in chaos’s creation. She knows the power and conviction it took to lead some of the dragons down humanities path. Her champion dragons are the rare silver dragon breed The Legendary Platinum dragons. Silver dragons take after her the most and they too are obsessed with humanity.

Before the prime material plane she didn’t have a need for a creation. She guided and aided which ever brother needed her help. Which at the time didn’t happen often for either side. When there were only the upper and the lower planes balanced was reached. It was chaotic and ever changing but no one side could actually tip the scale. Chaos was annoyed for centuries he stoked the flame between brothers. While chaos was permanent, there was also balance and true perfect chaos could never be reached. Chaos instilled the idea of a perfectly ordered world filled with righteous law in phorsphorans head. Then he told Vandiand of phorsphorans plan. The world was forged and with it a new breath of chaos would come. While her brothers fought she seized her opportunity to seed the world with balance. She looked up at chaos who tried to hide his excitement of the world, and gave him a wink knowing that with her start the other gods would follow. The mold had been cast, the baseline set, the template drawn.
