# Description and Origin

## Artifacts - End & Beginning
End & Beginning are more powerful when combined together

"To pick up your end, you must start your beginning and to pick up your beginning you must complete your end."
- End was able to be drawn because I began my new life as Azrael, no longer Camael. 

To combine End & Beginning, complete the 3rd quest (unknown), go to the World Forge as or with a competent black smith.
