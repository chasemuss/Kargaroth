# Description and Origin
The first born of the three High gods, Phorsphoran has a vast distance between himself and the mortal realm. As the father of angels, any follower wishing to communicate with him goes through his hierarchy of angles. His chosen race the Aasimar are no exception, but they are born with the true language he speaks. His word of god is always written in celestial, any other tablet or prophecy written in anything else is a fake and a mockery to his name. Such blasphemy will be met with his divine fury. Though the pinnacle of the good, mercy and compassion are not things the god holds in spades. His divinity has lifted him beyond the understanding of the mortals whom worship him. As too is his understanding of them. Phorsphoran has no enemies, all who consider themselves such meet a swift and painless end. Even amongst the gods none stand against him, not openly at least. His brother and sister the exception. His brother Vandiand his mirror opposite, and his sister Seraphina are the only ones of equal power.

Phorsphoran was the first born by [[Chaos, the Infinity|Chaos]] and the pinnacle of Holy power
