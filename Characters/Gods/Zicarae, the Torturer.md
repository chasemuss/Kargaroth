# Description and Origin

Despite being a 3rd tier god her ambitions and goals far surpass that of her fellow gods. She has a particular hatred for Seraphina the goddess who locked all the gods behind the great divide and brought about the cataclysm. Evil and Good aligned gods rarely if ever agree on anything but this time they both agree this divide was a mistake. The neutral aligned gods agree with Seraphina, except for her children of magic. While the other gods stew in their contempt for their circumstance Zicarae knows what is done must also be capable of being undone. For Centuries she plotted and schemed and now finally all the pieces are in motion to bring about her rival in the world. There she will stand the sole God of the world and will rule over it with absolute power, all will fall before the power and awe that is she. All the while the other gods helplessly watch from behind the divide.
