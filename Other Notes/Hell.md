Common Language: Infernal

Everything in hell wants to kill us "because its hell" (very xenophobic)
- Our high level may help deter devils from fighting us. If they die there, they can't come back. 
- How to kill them:
	- From Hell: Immune to Fire & Poisons; Not very vulnerable to other things: radiant / magic weapons may help. Fighting with words & trickery is better (see below)
	- Visitors to Hell: 
Best way to traverse hell is to make a deal
- Make a contract with a devil to guarantee protection. 
	- Can be a task or trade
	- If we want something from someone, then we need to offer something of equal or greater value. 
		- We will be told what the devil wants. 
		- Could be information, favors, trinkets, etc. 
	- Take the letter of the contract into consideration more than the spirit of the contract.
